This software gives you the facility to use char drivers from any computer connected to a network. For example, you may open a /dev/dsp (audio device) from a computer A, using the audio device located (phisically) at computer B.

It has three parts:
-ncdd kernel module, which runs in the client computer
-client daemon, also runs in the client computer
-server daemon, which runs in the server computer (where the devices that you use are located)
It implements open/close/read/write/seek functions on char devices, and ioctl calls with some limitations.

It compiles in any kernel 2.4; I'd like to make a 2.6 version but I have little free time to do it
